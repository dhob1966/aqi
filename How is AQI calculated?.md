How is AQI calculated?
1. The Sub-indices for individual pollutants at a monitoring location are calculated using its
24-hourly average concentration value (8-hourly in case of CO and O3) and health
breakpoint concentration range. The worst sub-index is the AQI for that location.

2. All the eight pollutants may not be monitored at all the locations. Overall AQI is
calculated only if data are available for minimum three pollutants out of which one should
necessarily be either PM2.5 or PM10. Else, data are considered insufficient for calculating
AQI. Similarly, a minimum of 16 hoursâ€™ data is considered necessary for calculating subindex.

3. The sub-indices for monitored pollutants are calculated and disseminated, even if data are
inadequate for determining AQI. The Individual pollutant-wise sub-index will provide air
quality status for that pollutant.

4. The web-based system is designed to provide AQI on real time basis. It is an automated
system that captures data from continuous monitoring stations without human
intervention, and displays AQI based on running average values (e.g. AQI at 6am on a
day will incorporate data from 6am on previous day to the current day).

5. For manual monitoring stations, an AQI calculator is developed wherein data can be fed
manually to get AQI value.

    The AQI calculation uses 7 measures: PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx, NH3, CO and O3.
    
    For PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx and NH3 the average value in last 24-hrs is used with the condition of having at least 16 values.
    
    For CO and O3 the maximum value in last 8-hrs is used.
    
    Each measure is converted into a Sub-Index based on pre-defined groups.
    Sometimes measures are not available due to lack of measuring or lack of required data points.
    Final AQI is the maximum Sub-Index with the condition that at least one of PM2.5 and PM10 should be available and at least three out of the seven should be available.
